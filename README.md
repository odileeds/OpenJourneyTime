# OpenJourneyTime
Open Journey Times pairs and isochrones for Great Britain. Calculated using the [Open Trip Planner for Great Britain](https://github.com/thomasforth/otp4gb) project. All journeys and isochrones are for arrival at the destination by 0830am on September 9th 2019. Walking, cycling, and driving speeds are the default in Open Trip Planner. Public Transport is using the timetable on that day and includes journeys by all modes (train, tram, bus, metro, etc...).

Current outputs are,
* Journey Time pairs for all MSOAs in Sheffield City Region by walking, bicycle, car, and public transport.
* Journey Times from all Data Zone Centroids in Scotland to all Workplace Zone Centroids. Journeys over 60 minutes are not reported. 

Further outputs will be available if,
* People add them.
* I can raise funding to do them.
* I am able to make further performance improvement to my methods for calculation.
* The UK government is less unhelpful. (this is why Scottish and Welsh data and data for North England will be available first).

I have tried hard to ensure that all input data is Open Government Licence and that all code used for processing does not leave the output data encumbered in any further way. The output data is thus Open Government Licence.
